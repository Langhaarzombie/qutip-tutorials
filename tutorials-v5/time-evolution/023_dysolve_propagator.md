# Calculate time propagators with Dysolve

Author: Mathis Beaudoin, 2025

### Introduction

This notebook shows how to compute time propagators with Dysolve using QuTiP. Dysolve is a method to compute time propagators for hamiltonians of the form $H(t) = H_0 + \cos(\omega t)X$ where $H_0$ is some base hamiltonian and $X$ a perturbation. It performs better than other general methods for this class of hamiltonians and, later on, should support more complicated oscillating perturbations. It is still in development with more features to come in the future. For more details on Dysolve, see the corresponding guide in the documentation.

For the moment, Dysolve can be used with the class `DysolvePropagator` and the function `dysolve_propagator` from QuTiP's solvers. They follow a similar structure to the class `Propagator` and the function `propagator`, another solver that also computes time propagators. 

### One qubit example using `DysolvePropagator`

Let's start by importing the necessary packages.

```python
from qutip.solver.dysolve_propagator import DysolvePropagator
from qutip import sigmax, sigmaz
```

We have to define what $H_0$, $X$ and $\omega$ will be. Let's say $H(t) = \sigma_z + \cos(10t)\sigma_x$.

```python
H_0 = sigmaz()
X = sigmax()
omega = 10.0
```

Some options can be defined. `max_order` will be the order of approximation used when calculating a propagator. The higher this integer is, the more precise the results will be (at a cost of taking more time to calculate). `a_tol` is simply the absolute tolerance used in the calculations. Finally, a time propagator can be computed using subpropagators of time increment `max_dt`. Let's say `max_dt` is set to 0.25, then the propagator $U(1, 0)$ will come from the multiplication of supropagators $U(0.25, 0)$, $U(0.5, 0.25)$, $U(0.75, 0.5)$ and $U(1, 0.75)$. This allows for more precise results when the evolution is over a long period of time. In our case, let's keep `a_tol` and `max_dt` to their default value, but let's change `max_order`.

```python
options = {'max_order': 5}
```

Everything is now defined to initialize an instance.

```python
dy = DysolvePropagator(H_0, X, omega, options=options)
```

Then, to compute a time propagator, simply call the instance with a given initial time and final time. Also, only a final time can be given and, in that case, the initial time is considered to be 0.

```python
t_i = -1
t_f = 1
U = dy(t_f, t_i)
```

### Simulation

Let's define a simple Hamiltonian and use `qutip.sesolve` to solve the
Schr√∂dinger equation and look at the expectation value of $\sigma_y$. You can
also use comments in the code section to separate the operations you perform.

```python
# simulate the unitary dynamics
H = sigmaz()
times = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
result = sesolve(H, psi, times, [sigmay()])

# plot the expectation value
plt.plot(times, result.expect[0])
plt.xlabel("Time"), plt.ylabel("<sigma_y>")
plt.show()
```

We created a nice looking plot of the Larmor precision. Every notebook has to
include the `qutip.about()` call at the end, to show the setup under which the
notebook was executed and make it reproducible for others.

### About

```python
qutip.about()
```

### Testing

This section can include some tests to verify that the expected outputs are
generated within the notebook. We put this section at the end of the notebook,
so it's not interfering with the user experience. Please, define the tests
using `assert`, so that the cell execution fails if a wrong output is generated.

```python
assert np.allclose(result.expect[0][0], 0), \
    "Expectation value does not start at 1"
assert 1 == 1
```

```python

```
